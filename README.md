## Data Analysis Capstone Project on Telecom Company 

This project is aimed towards building an interactive dashboard to understand customers demographic characteristics based on the influencing factors such as mobile usage, geolocation, and mobile device properties. We also need to find the customers behavioral characteristics and suggest actionable insights, thus helping INSAID improve it's marketing strategy and product terms.

### Conclusion
EDA is a crucial step to take before diving into machine learning & it is valuable to the data scientist to make certain that the results they produce are valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts.

The analysis of the user data helped us reach the following conclusions:

- Amongst the 6 states, Uttar Pradesh & Tamil Nadu holds the highest number of customers.
- Within Uttar Pradesh, Ghaziabad was the top city in terms of highest number of users.
- Within Tamil Nadu, highest number of users came from Thiruvallur.
- From the given dataset, we found that the highest number of users for Insaid Telecom were Males in the Age group of 20-40 years.
- Xiaomi, Samsung & Huawei were the top 3 most preferred brands amongst both men and women, across all age –groups.
- Mobile models used did not change much with Gender or Age.
- Network Usage peaked during mornings (4AM to 8AM) and Evenings (4PM to 8PM) during the time period of this dataset.

### Actionable Insights
- Insaid Telecom needs to make sincere efforts to increase their presence in Chandigarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Manipur since these states have only a handful of users for their network. This is a huge opportunity for Insaid Telecom to increase their market share and revenues.
- The network needs to improve usage amongst Female customers, since currently the network has only 33% of Total users who are Female. Hence, Insaid Telecom needs targeted marketing campaigns to reach out to Female customers.
- In terms of the Age Group, Insaid Telecom needs to focus on people older than 50 years, since Insaid Telecom does not have many users in this age group. This is another opportunity for Insaid Telecom, as the adoption of smart phone is now slowly increasing in this age group.
- Insaid Telecom has a third opportunity to expand its user base in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu by targeting smaller cities in both these states, where there are few users for their network.
- Insaid Telecom should also consider partnering with Xiaomi, Samsung and/or Huawei (for selected models) to provide value added service to its customers for retention, since these are the top 3 brands that Insaid’s customers are using.
